### [Project Description](doc/Proj1_desc.md)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2023

+ Projec title: Processing of the HappyDB corpus data into the processed moments data. 
+ This project is conducted by [Boyu Li]

+ Project summary: Findings: 

The top 10 most frequently occurring words in described moments are friend, day, time, family, watched, home, played, feel, finally, and found. It seems that people feel happy when they spend time with the friends and/or family, which is as expected of us as social beings. There are also verbs in the top 10 words such as watched, played, and found. Activities such as watching and playing can indeed be associated with being happy. Meanwhile, the word found could be the feeling of happiness when a person finally founds something after some time.

The distribution of happy words between males and females show interesting results. For instance, the words crochet, makeup, affirmations, balloon, babysit, nails, boyfriend, and husband are leaning more towards females. Particularly, the terms husband and boyfriends are at the upper end, implying that there are more females who associated happiness with the terms boyfriend and husband, probably making them happy. Other terms on the upper end are mom and baby. On the other hand, for males, terms that make more of them happy are auto, components, alcohol, cigarrete, nba, basketball, wife, and girlfriend. Hence, material things such as cars, components of some things, and vices such cigarette and alcohol seem to make most males happy. On the upper end, similar to females, males are made happy by their partners - wife and girlfriend.

Similarly, the most frequent bigrams for males and females respectively are interesting. For females,the top bigrams that made the most sense are spending time, birthday celebration, husband in home, and moments in life. For males on the other hand, the bigrams that made the most sense are spending time, game with a friend, playing game, and birthday celebration. In both males and females, spending time and celebrating a birthday seem to be one of the top causes of being happy.
